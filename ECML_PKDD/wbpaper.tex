%Jianing's abstract
  
 %In technical terms, we are interested in estimating heterogeneity in causal effects and conduct inference about the magnitude of the differences in project effects across subsets of world bank projects. To do so, we analyze a data set with data on world bank projects from 1982 to 2014 that contains project characteristics, geographical, and environmental data such as temperature and precipitation.
% as well as spatial and spatially related information.  
%The key challenge for this analysis is that the observational data does not allow us to directly measure the difference between the result of performing a project and of not performing a project as reality only gives us the choice to do one of the two.
%Following recent research results by Athey and Imbens, we employ a combination of machine learning techniques such as random forests with techniques from causal inference to measure the average treatment effect, i.e. the average effect of a project, for subsets of geographic locations. We validate our findings with project evaluations from the world bank and outcomes of competing econometric models.

\begin{abstract}

The World Bank provides hundreds of millions of dollars in development finance to countries across the world every year.  In order to ensure these funds are being spent as effectively as possible, there is a natural drive to promote better understandings of what projects work and which don't.  However, the global extent of these projects results in a great deal of heterogeneity in impacts due to geographic, cultural, and other factors.  Recent research by Athey and Imbens has illustrated the potential for hybrid machine learning and causal inferential techniques which may be able to capture such heterogeneity.  We apply their approach using a geolocated dataset of World Bank projects, and augment this data with satellite-retrieved characteristics of their geographic context (including temperature, precipitation, slope, distance to urban areas, and many others).  We use this information in conjunction with causal tree(CT), transformed outcome tree (TOT), and random forest with TOT trees approaches to (a) segment the data into relevant 'control' and 'treatment' groups, and (b) examine the impact of World Bank projects on vegetative cover.  We contrast our findings with project evaluations from the World Bank, and outcomes of more traditional, empirical econometric models.

\section{Conclusions}
issues: number of control units in leaves

precision of answers

robustness of random forest for TOT

spill over effect in spatial data (big project next to untreated case)

spatial diversity in leaf nodes (not just diversity in values)
